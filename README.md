This project is aimed at developing a scheduler for group meetings.


This is a web-based tool. Any user can call for a meeting and send the detailed co-ordinates of the meeting (location, date, time, room, etc) to all invitees. Invitees should receive invitation links via mail, and either accept or decline the invitation.


This is useful for a small office, school or a department or for that matter any group who is interested to organise it effectively. Users should be able to book a room for their meetings only if the room is available at the stipulated time.
